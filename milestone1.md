<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p><b>1.</b> The server in <b>Server.java</b> listens for incoming client connections on a specified<br>port using a <b>ServerSocket</b>. It creates a new <b>ServerThread</b> to handle each connected<br>client, and these threads are responsible for handling client-server communication. The server can<br>accept multiple client connections at the same time.<div><b>2.</b>&nbsp;The client in <b>Client.java</b> accepts user<br>input, including connecting to a server using the <b>&quot;/connect&quot;</b> command with an IP<br>address (in this case, localhost) and port (in this case, 3000). When a<br>connection is requested, the client creates a Socket and communicates with the server<br>through an <b>ObjectOutputStream</b> and an <b>ObjectInputStream</b>. The client can send messages to the<br>server, and the server can send messages back to the client.</div><div><b>3. </b>The client<br>issues a <b>&quot;/connect&quot;</b> command with the server&#39;s IP address and port. The connect<br>method in the client creates a new Socket and sets up input and<br>output streams for communication. The client establishes a connection with the server using<br>the specified IP address and port. The server accepts the client&#39;s connection request,<br>creating a new <b>ServerThread </b>to handle the client. The server&#39;s <b>ServerThread </b>communicates with<br>the client through an <b>ObjectOutputStream </b>and an <b>ObjectInputStream</b>. The server and client can<br>exchange messages through their respective streams.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>My screenshot shows my two clients, which are the second and third split<br>terminals, successfully establishing a connection with the server. The clients have also been<br>set up in a way in which they can send messages to the<br>server, and the server sends the message to all clients within the same<br>room. There is also a client identifier, specifically a name, that demonstrates who<br>the message was sent from (Mohammed, Mohammed2), and when a message is sent<br>within one room, that message cannot be seen in another room (room1, room2).<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the messages are sent, broadcasted (sent to all connected clients), and received</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Messages are sent from the client perspective in <b>Client.java</b> by entering a message<br>in the terminal, which is then passed to the <b>sendMessage</b> method. The message<br>is encapsulated in a Payload object along with the client's name and payload<br>type. From the <b>ServerThread</b> perspective in <b>Server.java</b>, messages received from clients are processed<br>within the run method. The server differentiates between message types (connect, disconnect, message),<br>extracts the message content, and routes it to the appropriate room, ensuring that<br>it is broadcasted only to clients in the same room. From the Room<br>perspective in <b>Server.java</b>, messages are received from the server and broadcasted to all<br>clients within the room using the <b>sendMessage</b> method. Finally, from the client perspective<br>(receiving), messages are displayed in the client's terminal upon receiving and are clearly<br>shown with the sender's name and message content, demonstrating the flow of messages<br>in the chat application</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>My screenshot captures the clients disconnecting from the server, which continues running to<br>run without issues. Disconnection messages are displayed in the client terminal, showcasing the<br>server&#39;s successful handling of disconnections. The server is intentionally terminated, causing clients 1<br>and 2 to be disconnected. However, clients can successfully reconnect after the server<br>is restarted.<br></p>
</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the various disconnects/terminations are handled</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The disconnections and terminations are effectively handled. From a Socket perspective, a client<br>disconnects by using the /quit command or closing the client program, which triggers<br>the client's successful disconnection from the server. The client program doesn't crash when<br>the server disconnects or terminates because it includes exception handling to prevent any<br>crashes when the server goes offline. The server doesn't crash when client(s) disconnect,<br>which allows it to continue running and successfully handle client disconnections. This ensures<br>a stable application.</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>During this assignment, I gained valuable insights into the handling of client-server interactions<br>using Java sockets. I encountered and addressed challenges to Professor Toegel via Discord<br>related to socket communication, as well as disconnections and reconnections. Professor Toegel's assistance<br>and guidance helped me tremendously in completing the deliverables for this assignment. This<br>assignment also provided me with a practical understanding of network programming concepts.</div><br></td></tr>
